# Changelog

## 2026-04-23

### Added
- **Hermes auto-detection**: When no explicit `LLM_PROVIDER`/`LLM_MODEL` env vars are set, the pipeline reads `~/.hermes/config.yaml` and resolves runtime credentials so the digest automatically follows the same model/provider as the active agent session. Supports Nous Research, OpenRouter, Anthropic, and Ollama/custom providers.
- **kimi-k2.6 compatibility**: Added reasoning-model support — detects empty `content` responses and falls back to `reasoning` field. Auto-sets `temperature=1` for kimi models. Gracefully handles unsupported `response_format` by retrying without it.
- **Token guard**: Prompts are automatically truncated to fit within the target model's context window, preventing overflow errors on large article batches.

### Fixed
- Fixed missing `summarize_weekly` import in `analysis/weekly.py` that broke weekly LLM synthesis.
- Removed hardcoded `minimax-m2.7:cloud` fallback from `dry_run.py` and `full_dry_run.py` so scripts respect env/.env/Hermes config.
- Fixed Telegram renderer to embed links on headlines instead of source names, matching modern Telegram formatting preferences.
- Removed dead `send_to_chat.py` script.

### Changed
- Updated the fetch pipeline to support both RSS sources and page-based sources.
- Updated summarization to support `ollama`, `openai`, `openrouter`, and `anthropic`.

### Notes
- Daily reports are now archived under `data/daily_reports/YYYY-MM-DD/` as both `digest.txt` and `digest.json`.
